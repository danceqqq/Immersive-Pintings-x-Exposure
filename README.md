# Immersive Paintings × Exposure

## 📖 Description

**Immersive Paintings × Exposure** is an addon mod that bridges the gap between [Immersive Paintings](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immersive-paintings) and [Exposure](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/exposure), allowing you to use your Exposure photographs as custom paintings in Immersive Paintings frames.
## ✨ Features

- **Seamless Integration**: Adds a new "Exposure" tab to the Immersive Paintings GUI
- **Photo Preview**: View thumbnail previews of your Exposure photographs directly in the selection menu
- **Easy Selection**: Browse and select photos from your Exposure collection with an intuitive interface
- **World-Specific**: Automatically detects and displays photos from the current world
- **Smart Positioning**: Button placement adapts to your GUI layout
## 🎮 How It Works

1. Take photos using the **Exposure** mod
2. Open any painting frame editing interface from **Immersive Paintings**
3. Click on the new **"Exposure"** tab (located at the bottom next to pagination controls)
4. Browse your photos with thumbnail previews
5. Select a photo to apply it to your painting frame
6. Enjoy your custom artwork!
## 📸 Photo Location

Your Exposure photos should be located at:
- `[game_directory]/exposures/[world_name]/[player_name]_[id].png`

The mod automatically detects photos from the current world and displays them in the selection menu.
